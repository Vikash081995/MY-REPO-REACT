//if you call setState and immediately console.log(this.state),it will very likely print the old state instead of new one 

//state={count:3}
//this.setState({count:4})
//console.log(this.state);

//to immediately act on the new state, pass in callback function as 2nd argument to setState
//this.setState({name:'joe'},()=>{})
